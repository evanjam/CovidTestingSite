to do list from 10-19-21 meeting

-user session handling
--think "session variables"
---think of the patient dashboard, needs to know "who" is opening their dashboard? 
session variable saving their UID right

-most of our current insertion forms show a blank html echo statement after doing
the insertion. obviously fix this. make things refresh themself? or redirect dashboard?
-still notify the person that the insertion was successful, but stay on current page and show 
that echo statement. kinda thing. 
--"insert success?"

-add sign out button to dashboard (topic of user sessions, redirect to login and 'clear session'
-we already have home buttons? keep pushing in this direction

-add "change password" button to dashboards
--new form required for this
--use same style sheet as login form (login.css)
**session based change password screen? or just same as forgot password? 
***if you're already logged in, then you can just type current password + 
2x new password.

-forgot password
--everyone can access the forgot password form, link from the login screen
--(use login.css)
--username, ssn, enter new pw twice (and then do the whole "UPDATE blah WHERE blah"
**maybe leave option open for an email situation? (evan warns us about SMTP relay)

-think about more admin functionality
-reset passwords? ->>>
--create admin\password reset form
--list all usernames
--click a username, (or maybe just type in the username)
 field to enter password (2x) ((confirm password))
-edit details of an account? 
--they technically already have access to the lab dashboard so they can already edit results
but NOT sign

-we are NOT displaying 0, 1, 2 for test results (not ready, negative, positive)
--ACTUALLY display the words "not ready", "negative", "positive"
--same thing for doctor_signed - dont just say 0 or 1
--also CHANGE the doctor form so they aren't manually inputting shit (radio boxes, or maybe
just a bigg ol button that says SIGN and they press sign and then it changes isSigned to 1)
